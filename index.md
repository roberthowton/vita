<!-- ## Currently

I am Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Koç University in Istanbul. My research interests lie principally in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and the philosophy of perception. Currently, I am writing on a cluster of topics in Aristotle’s psychology and natural science, including: perceptual discrimination, the metaphysics of color and other sensible qualities, the epistemic value of sense experience, and the status of soul as a final cause in the Aristotelian life sciences. -->

## dissertation abstract

_Aristotle's Case for Perceptual Knowledge_. My dissertation addresses one of the most controversial but least well understood claims of Aristotle’s psychology: that sense perception is a “discriminative” (_kritikê_) capacity of soul. I argue that commentators have misunderstand the nature and significance of this claim because they have failed to appreciate the extent to which Aristotle is responding to his predecessors, above all Plato, who _denied_ that the senses discriminate. Properly situated in this dialectical context, Aristotle’s claim can be seen for what it is: a defense of the naïve view that _experience_ of a quality like color or flavor can be a way of _knowing_ that quality.

Aristotle’s primary target is an argument he finds in Plato’s _Theaetetus_. According to this argument, perception can be a kind of knowledge only if we accept the naïve view that sensory experience of colors, flavors, and other perceptual qualities reveals the _essence_ of those qualities. For Plato, however, the naïve view is wrong: though it may be via the senses that the soul perceives qualities like a hard thing’s hardness or a soft thing’s softness, it cannot by via the senses that the soul discriminates the _being_ of these qualities. To do that, Plato argued, the soul must act on its own.

Against this, Aristotle argues in _De Anima_ 2.11 (424a5--7) that the senses _themselves_ discriminate the qualities they perceive. His argument depends on a view of perceptual qualities as objective, perceiver-independent properties of perceptible bodies. As I argue in Chapters 1 and 2, Aristotle views colors, flavors, and the like as essentially _causal_ properties, the physical features of perceptible bodies that enable them to produce experiences of those qualities in us. But Aristotle, unlike modern physicalists, denies that there is a necessary contrast between the way a perceptual quality appears in experience and the way it essentially is. Since a perceptual quality is “mixture _and_ motion”, it can appear in experience as the perceiver-independent property it essentially is.

The argument of _De Anima_ 2.11 aims to spell out the psychological conditions under which perceptual qualities appear in experience as they essentially are. The argument is difficult, relying on the obscure notion that the senses are “mean states” of the qualities they perceive. In Chapters 3 and 4, I clarify this notion by developing an analogy with his celebrated doctrine of the ethical mean. Because virtue is a mean state, vicious actions and emotions appear to the virtuous person as what they essentially are, namely excessive or deficient. Similarly, because each sense is a mean state, the qualities it perceives appear to it as what they essentially are, namely light or dark, sweet or bitter, or more generally as occupying the objective position on the quality scale that defines each as the quality it is. For a sense to “discriminate” a perceptual quality, then, is for that quality to appear to the _sensory_ mean state as what it essentially is.

Aristotle’s claim that the senses discriminate thus represents a decisive rejection of Plato’s contention that the soul by itself discriminates the essence of perceptual qualities, as well as unequivocal support for the naïve view of sense experience, which for he and Plato alike is a condition for perceptual knowledge. -->
